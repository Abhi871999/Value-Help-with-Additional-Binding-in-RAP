3. Now create one consumption view ‘ZVS_C_MAT_STOCK’ on top of Interface view 'ZVS_I_MAT_STOCK': - 

The consumption view zvs_c_mat_stock projects the data from the interface view zvs_i_mat_stock.
This view is intended to expose the data for transactional operations, such as create, update, and delete. 
The consumption view allows clients to interact with the data, but the actual persistence and behavior are managed through the behavior definition.
