Value Help with Additional Binding in RAP â€“ Filtering Storage Locations by Plant in Material Stock Management 

Introduction:
I will demonstrate how to implement Value Help with Additional Binding in a RAP (RESTful ABAP Programming) application for the MM module. The scenario involves managing Material Stock Information by providing value help for Plant (WERKS) and Storage Location (LGORT). The key feature is filtering the storage location list dynamically based on the selected plant, enhancing the user experience. 

When the user selects a Plant, the system automatically filters the Storage Location (LGORT) list to show only the storage locations related to the selected plant. 

The requirement is to build a Fiori-based RAP application that enables users to: 

Select a Plant from the dropdown. 
Dynamically filter the Storage Locations based on the selected Plant. 
Display and manage material stock details such as material number, plant, storage location, stock quantity, and unit of measure.
